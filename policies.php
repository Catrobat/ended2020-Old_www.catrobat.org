  <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>Version 1.2, 16 April 2013</p>
  <p>Your privacy and safety online are very important to us. To protect your privacy, we limit what we collect and what we publish on the website.</p>
  <p>Using Catrobat Software Applications and Services (as described in our <a href="terms">Terms of Use</a>)
You do not have to tell us anything about yourself to download Catrobat application software. When you download Catrobat software or sign up to a Catrobat website, we give you the option of telling us some things about yourself, but you do not have to fill in any of this information if you want to.</p>
  <p>Although you can try out user contributed programs on Catrobat websites without registering or providing any information, we collect some data on where you click and which parts of the site you visit. This 'click data' helps us figure out ways to improve the websites. We do not sell or rent your information to anyone.</p>

  <h2>Copyright Policy</h2>
	<p>Version 2.0, 2 April 2013</p>
	<p>The Catrobat team respects the intellectual property of others, as well as of our users.
		If you believe that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please send us an <a href="m&#97;il&#116;&#111;&#58;&#119;&#101;&#98;mas&#X74;&#101;r&#64;cat&#114;&#X6f;bat.&#111;&#114;&#X67;?subject=Copyright%20Policy">email</a>.</p>
  <p>We will promptly process and investigate notices of alleged infringement and will take appropriate actions under the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001L0029:EN:HTML" target="_blank">Directive 2001/29/EC</a> and other applicable intellectual property laws. Upon receipt, the Catrobat team may act expeditiously to remove or disable access to any material claimed to be infringing. Repeat infringers of third-party copyrights are subject to termination of our services in appropriate circumstances.</p>
  <p>In assessing whether or not a Catrobat user has violated your copyrights, please keep in mind that Catrobat is an educational and not-for-profit initiative, seeking to aid young people's learning by providing the tools for them to learn and express themselves using digital technology.</p>
  <p>We hope you also see Catrobat not only as a good way of popularizing your creations but also as an opportunity to do something good for young people's education.</p>
  <p>If you choose to make a copyright infringement complaint, please note that we may post your notification, with personally identifiable information redacted, to a clearinghouse such as <a href="http://chillingeffects.org" target="_blank">chillingeffects.org</a>. Please also note that you may be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that an activity is infringing your copyright.</p>
