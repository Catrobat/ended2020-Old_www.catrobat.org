    <h1><img class="header-icon" src="img/icon_apps.png" />Our Apps</h1>
    <p>With our two basic apps - Pocket Code and Pocket Paint - we offer the ideal environment to let our users' ideas become true. They can start building a new app from scratch by using Pocket Code and design it with the help of Pocket Paint. With the user friendly &ldquo;Lego-Style&rdquo; programing language no prior knowledge is needed. By exploring their friends' projects and importing them into Pocket Code our users can learn programing from the community. Users are able to add their own ideas and redesign imported apps by using Pocket Paint. If they want to put more focus on programing their very own app they can also use the provided design templates from our huge media library.</p>

      <p>Pocket Code  is a mobile visual programming framework for smartphones and tablets. It allows users to develop games and animations directly on their device, by simply sticking bricks together. No computer or advanced knowledge is needed. The user-friendly &ldquo;Lego-Style&rdquo; approach of Pocket Code aims at enabling children and teenagers to creatively develop their own apps and share them with their friends and the whole community.</p>

      <p>Pocket Paint is an easy to use and powerful painting app, which perfectly works together with Pocket Code and all the other Catrobat tools. Several features such as transparent backgrounds, a stamp function and different geometric figures enable users to create their very own designs directly on their phone. The created graphics can be directly included and used in Pocket Code or saved on any device.</p>

      <h2>Mindstorms</h2>
      <p>The Mindstorm plugin for Pocket Code allows users to take control of the famous Lego Mindstorm robots and program them for their personal needs. Once again the simple brick-framework makes it possible to connect robots to a device directly via bluetooth and program them within minutes. Nothing but Pocket Code and the Mindstorm plugin is needed to create software for Lego Mindstorms and control the robots with a self-build remote control.</p>

      <h2>Arduino</h2>
      <p>With the Arduino plugin for Pocket Code our users can fully control an Arduino board using the Arduino Standard Firmata Library via Bluetooth. This plugin makes it possible to change the Digital and PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) pins and read the Analog Pins of the board. In just a few minutes users can create their very own Arduino project by using the provided bricks and sensor functions and integrate their Arduino board actively into Pocket Code apps.</p>
