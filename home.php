    <h1><img class="header-icon" src="img/icon_mission.png" />Our Mission</h1>
    <p>The nonprofit Catrobat project aims at developing solutions which inspire teenagers and kids to learn coding, get creative and be prepared for the digital future of our world. Simple logical processes, creative solutions and easily understandable connections are essential in the world of tomorrow. Our vision is to provide young people with the chance to include these principles in their everyday digital-life. We believe that free, age-based and motivating software, which can be used directly by teenagers, or in education, is essential in order to prepare the next generation for their future.</p>

    <div class="two-split">
      <p class="no-break">Free tools enable teenagers to take the leap from being a passive user to become a creative developer. With apps like Pocket Code, users get the chance to use their mobile devices in a meaningful and, most importantly, fun way, without the need of being a professional developer. The visual &ldquo;Lego-Style&rdquo; programming framework, which is used in our projects, enables everyone to design their very own apps, without any limitations such as there are in a common programming language. With the right tools, creating apps, games and animations can be as simple as anything! It can be done by anyone, anytime and everywhere.</p>
